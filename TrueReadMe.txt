Hello!
This project is just to take a project we did in React, tictactoe, and put it into gatsby.
There were some struggles along the way, since I am slowly learning js and react and all, 
	with how they work; however the instructor was very helpful in advising me.
There are 3 files for javascript in src; index, game, and board.
	The latter 2 files are pieces of the original tictactoe with exports at the end.
